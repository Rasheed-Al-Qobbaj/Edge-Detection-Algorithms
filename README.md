# Edge Detection Algorithms

This project is a comprehensive study of various edge detection algorithms. It includes the implementation of several edge detection algorithms and a comparison of their performance.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Roberts Edge Detection
2. Sobel Edge Detection
3. Prewitt Edge Detection
4. Laplacian Edge Detection
5. Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) Edge Detection
6. Difference of Gaussians (DoG) Edge Detection
7. Canny Edge Detection

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook (`Report.ipynb`). You can run the notebook to see the implementation and comparison of the algorithms.

## Results

The Canny Edge Detection algorithm outperformed the other algorithms, followed by the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) algorithms. The Sobel and Prewitt algorithms performed similarly, while the Roberts algorithm performed the worst.
